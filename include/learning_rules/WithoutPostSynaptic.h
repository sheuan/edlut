 * This file declares a class which implements a learning rule without postsynaptic learning. In this case, each learning rule definition includes a parameter 
 * named trigger that can be set to 0 (no trigger connection) or 1 (trigger connection). When a spike reaches a neuron through a synapse that implements these 
 * learning rules, this synapse updates its weight considering this activity (LTP or LTD). Additionally, when the learning rule associated to this synapse is
 * of trigger type, this spike throws another learning mechanism (LTD or LTP) over all the input synapses of that neuron considering their past presynaptic activity.
